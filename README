Qt project written in Python

My first Qt project written in Python. Initially, my goal was learning Qt by coding the design layout myself (ie. not using Qt Designer). You can find these .ui files in the "old design" branch. 

The model-view-controller were all in the same file (I had not heard of the MVC software design pattern when starting this project). For example, the login.py file contains a class for the login window GUI view with functions outside of the class serving as controller. Every new window/view of my application became a new .py file, which was incredibly inefficient. 

After becoming familiar with Qt coding through Python, I decided to make the entire UI through Qt Designer and import the .ui file (final_design.ui) into design.py. I further separated the sql functions into sql_functions.py, and the controller functions (which I named functions.py) were placed in their own file. I told my "programmer" friend about this, and he informed me of the model-view-controller software design pattern. 

I was happy to have a more workable pattern to my design, and just as happy to have "discovered" good design philosophy through my own trial and error.
