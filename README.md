Qt project written in Python

My first Qt project written in Python. GUI interface for a fictional school where students can look up their grades, and teachers can edit and update grades for individual classes and students.

- sql_functions.py - Functions for accessing MySQL database
- create_db.sql - Database file containing student, teacher, grade, and class information (Model)
- setup_gui.py - .py file made by Qt Designer to create GUI; converted from final_design.ui file (View)
- main.py - Main .py file containing controller functions (Controller)

- GUI made using Qt Designer
